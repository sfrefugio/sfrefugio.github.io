<h2 style="text-align: center;">TERMS OF SERVICE</h2> 
<p></p> 
<br />
The following terms and conditions govern all use of the PulmaCalc mobile application and all content, services and products available at or through the mobile application, (taken together, the Application). The Application is offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, PulmaCalc's Privacy Policy (http://PulmaCalcapp.com/privacy/)) and procedures that may be published from time to time on this Site by PulmaCalc (collectively, the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;).<br />
<br />
Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using the Application. By accessing or using any part of the Application, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access the Application or use any services. If these terms and conditions are considered an offer by PulmaCalc, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms. The Application is available only to individuals who are at least 13 years old.<br />
<br />
1. **Your PulmaCalc Account and Application.** If you create an account on the Application, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the Application. You must immediately notify PulmaCalc of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security. PulmaCalc will not be liable for any acts or omissions by You, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.<br />
<br />
2. **Responsibility of Contributors.** <br />
 If you post material or links on the Application, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available by means of the Application (any such material, &ldquo;Content&rdquo;), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of what form the Content takes, which includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio, or code. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that your content does not violate these terms or the User Guidelines (http://PulmaCalcapp.com/user-guidelines/). <br />
<br />
 By submitting Content to PulmaCalc, you grant PulmaCalc a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing, and promoting your content. This license allows PulmaCalc to make publicly-posted content available to third parties selected by PulmaCalc so that these third parties can analyze and distribute (but not publicly display) your content through their services. <br />
<br />
 If you delete Content, PulmaCalc will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Application, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable. <br />
<br />
 Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, PulmaCalc has the right (though not the obligation) to, in PulmaCalc's sole discretion (i) refuse or remove any content that, in PulmaCalc's reasonable opinion, violates any PulmaCalc policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of the Application to any individual or entity for any reason, in PulmaCalc's sole discretion. PulmaCalc will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.<br />
<br />
 When submitting content, the Application will require the user to provide an email address or a phone number of the recipient. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT TO US THAT EACH PERSON YOU ADDRESS HAS CONSENTED TO RECEIVING EMAIL OR TEXT MESSAGES FROM YOU AND YOU CONSENT PulmaCalc TO CONTACT EACH PERSON TO CARRY OUT OUR SERVICES. PulmaCalc will only use the supplied email addresses and phone numbers to inform the recipient of Content provided by you.<br />
<br />
3. **Responsibility of Application Users.** PulmaCalc has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, posted to the Application, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material&rsquo;s content, use or effects. By operating the Application, PulmaCalc does not represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. The Application may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. The Application may also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or infringes the intellectual property and other proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which is subject to additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated. PulmaCalc disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of the Application, or from any downloading by those visitors of content there posted.<br />
<br />
4. **Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy.** As PulmaCalc asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material located on the Application violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify PulmaCalc in accordance with PulmaCalc's Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&quot;DMCA&quot;) Policy (http://PulmaCalcapp.com/dmca-notice/). PulmaCalc will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. PulmaCalc will terminate a visitor's access to and use of the Application if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of PulmaCalc or others. In the case of such termination, PulmaCalc will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to PulmaCalc.<br />
<br />
5. **Intellectual Property.** This Agreement does not transfer from PulmaCalc to you any PulmaCalc or third party intellectual property, and all right, title and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with PulmaCalc. PulmaCalc, PulmaCalcApp.com, the PulmaCalcApp.com logo, and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with PulmaCalc, or the Application are trademarks or registered trademarks of PulmaCalc or PulmaCalc&rsquo;s licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with the Application may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of the Application grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any PulmaCalc or third-party trademarks.<br />
<br />
6. **Changes.** We are constantly updating our services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our services are offered. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by posting on one of our blogs, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new Terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using the Application within the designated notice period. Your continued use of the Application will be subject to the new Terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.<br />
<br />
7. **Termination.** PulmaCalc may terminate your access to all or any part of the Application at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. If you wish to terminate this Agreement or your PulmaCalc account (if you have one), you may simply discontinue using the Application. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.<br />
<br />
8. **Disclaimer of Warranties.** The Application is provided &quot;as is&quot;. PulmaCalc and its suppliers and licensors hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Neither PulmaCalc nor its suppliers and licensors, makes any warranty that the Application will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted. You understand that you download from, or otherwise obtain content or services through, the Application at your own discretion and risk.<br />
<br />
9. **Limitation of Liability.** In no event will PulmaCalc, or its suppliers or licensors, be liable with respect to any subject matter of this agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed the fees paid by you to PulmaCalc under this agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action. PulmaCalc shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.<br />
<br />
10. **General Representation and Warranty.** You represent and warrant that (i) your use of the Application will be in strict accordance with the PulmaCalc Privacy Policy, with this Agreement and with all applicable laws and regulations (including without limitation any local laws or regulations in your country, state, city, or other governmental area, regarding online conduct and acceptable content, and including all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside) and (ii) your use of the Application will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party.<br />
<br />
11. **US Economic Sanctions**. You expressly represent and warrant that your use of the Application and or associated services and products is not contrary to applicable U.S. Sanctions. Such use is prohibited, and PulmaCalc reserve the right to terminate accounts or access of those in the event of a breach of this condition.<br />
<br />
12. **Indemnification.** You agree to indemnify and hold harmless PulmaCalc, its contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims and expenses, including attorneys&rsquo; fees, arising out of your use of the Application, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement.<br />
<br />
13. **Translation.** These Terms of Service were originally written in English (US). We may translate these Terms into other languages. In the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms of Service and the English version, the English version will control.<br />
<br />
14. **Miscellaneous.** This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between PulmaCalc and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and they may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of PulmaCalc, or by the posting by PulmaCalc of a revised version. Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, this Agreement, any access to or use of the Application will be governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the same will be the state and federal courts located in Orange County, California. Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (&ldquo;JAMS&rdquo;) by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in Irvine, California, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys&rsquo; fees. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties&rsquo; original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; PulmaCalc may assign its rights under this Agreement without condition. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
