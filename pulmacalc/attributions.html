 &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or<br />
 Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br />
 copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<br />
 (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br />
<br />
 &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br />
 form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br />
 editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br />
 represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br />
 of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br />
 separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br />
 the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including<br />
 the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br />

 Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but<br />
 excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise<br />
 designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<br />
 on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and<br />
 subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br />
<br />
 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br />
 this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br />
 worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br />
 copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br />
 publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br />
 Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br />
<br />
 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br />
 this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br />
 worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br />
 (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br />
 use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br />
 where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br />
 by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br />
 Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br />
 with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br />
 institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br />
 cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br />
 or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br />
 or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br />
 granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br />
 as of the date such litigation is filed.<br />
<br />
 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br />
 Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br />
 modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br />
 meet the following conditions:<br />
<br />
 (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br />
 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br />
<br />
 (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br />
 stating that You changed the files; and<br />
<br />
 (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br />
 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br />
 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br />
 excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br />
 the Derivative Works; and<br />
<br />
 (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its<br />
 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br />
 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br />
 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br />
 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br />
 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br />
 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br />
 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br />
 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br />
 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br />
 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br />
 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br />
 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br />
 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br />
 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br />
 as modifying the License.<br />
<br />
 You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br />
 may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br />
 for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br />
 for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br />
 reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br />
 the conditions stated in this License.<br />
<br />
 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br />
 any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br />
 by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br />
 this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br />
 Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br />
 the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br />
 with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br />
<br />
 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br />
 names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br />
 except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br />
 origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br />
<br />
 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br />
 agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br />
 Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,<br />
 WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br />
 implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br />
 of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br />
 appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br />
 risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br />
<br />
 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br />
 whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br />
 unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br />
 negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br />
 liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br />
 incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />
 result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br />
 Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br />
 work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br />
 other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br />
 has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br />
<br />
 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br />
 the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br />
 and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br />
 or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br />
 License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br />
 on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br />
 of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br />
 defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br />
 incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br />
 of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br />
<br />
